                    water is falling here, in the city where my life took form, totally drenching   
                    everything without being in any way hard. i have been waiting for this kind of  
                    rain animal all my life, and in all the many deaths it has entailed. now, there 
                    is just the sound of gratitude pouring down, without the need to be translated. 
                </p>
                <p>                                                                                   
                    there is a way, the rain sings, to find love in every world we meet in this mani
                    fold existence. to be at one, without demanding that the many make sense. there 
                    is a way to atone, and to be forgiven, and to forgive.                          
                </p>
                <p>   
                    welcome to the fifth, final, and infinite part of the blue book trilogy. as with
                    every part before it, it builds on the work of countless others and would not be
                    possible without each one of them, nor would it be meaningful without you, and  
                    who you are before my words. this is for you. this is for you. this is for you. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    every chapter has a guardian. while i have found this version of the blue book, 
                    each guardian cares for the token which controls the code used to display where 
                    that chapter is in these infinite shelves. as such, they can change the code to 
                    point somewhere else. they can sell the token to another. they can do nothing.  
                    the array of choices guardians have is as endless as their own innate creative  
                    potential. the critical point is that each act any guardian takes is itself an  
                    artistic statement, and that is my intention with this project.

                    i mean to create sacred economic space. technologies like ethereum tie financial 
                    value to speech acts, so we can create ceremonial transactions where every       
                    economic agent is also an artist by virtue of how they choose to express the     
                    value of their gifts.

                    first of all, you need to know about the library of babel. made with the letters
                    of the latin alphabet, along with a space, a period and a comma, it contains all
                    possible pages of writing. the names of every type of protea on table mountain,
                    the number of butterflies that have flown out to sea on their one way migration
                    over mozambique every year, the amount of ash that the ganges has carried, along
                    with the names of every person that ash once was. in it can be found the secret
                    chord that pleased the lord and the most lewd french song ever sung. somewhere
                    in the endless shelves you will find the histories of every world as well as the
                    science fiction short story that would have saved them from their multiple fates.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    the point is, everything ever written on a page of 3200 characters is already in
                    the library of babel. this entire book was already in the library. all i had to
                    do to find it was write it. so who, then, is the real author. whence authority.
