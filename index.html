                        <br/>
                        water is falling here, in the city where my life took form, totally drenching   <br/>
                        everything without being in any way hard. i have been waiting for this kind of  <br/>
                        rain animal all my life, and in all the many deaths it has entailed. now, there <br/>
                        is just the sound of gratitude pouring down, without the need to be translated. <br/>
                        <br/>                                                                                
                        there is a way, the rain sings, to find love in every world we meet in this mani<br/>
                        fold existence. to be at one, without demanding that the many make sense. there <br/>
                        is a way to atone, and to be forgiven, and to forgive.                          <br/>
                        <br/>
                        welcome to the fifth, final, and infinite part of the blue book trilogy. as with<br/>
                        every part before it, it builds on the work of countless others and would not be<br/>
                        possible without each one of them, nor would it be meaningful without you, and  <br/>
                        who you are before my words. this is for you. this is for you. this is for you. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        every chapter has a guardian. while i have found this version of the blue book, <br/>
                        each guardian cares for the token which controls the code used to display where <br/>
                        that chapter is in these infinite shelves. as such, they can change the code to <br/>
                        point somewhere else. they can sell the token to another. they can do nothing.  <br/>
                        the array of choices guardians have is as endless as their own innate creative  <br/>
                        potential. the critical point is that each act any guardian takes is itself an  <br/>
                        artistic statement, and that is my intention with this project.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        i mean to create sacred economic space. technologies like ethereum tie financial <br/>
                        value to speech acts, so we can create ceremonial transactions where every       <br/>
                        economic agent is also an artist by virtue of how they choose to express the     <br/>
                        value of their gifts.                                                            <br/>

                    first of all, you need to know about the library of babel. made with the letters<br/>
                    of the latin alphabet, along with a space, a period and a comma, it contains all<br/>
                    possible pages of writing. the names of every type of protea on table mountain,<br/>
                    the number of butterflies that have flown out to sea on their one way migration<br/>
                    over mozambique every year, the amount of ash that the ganges has carried, along<br/>
                    with the names of every person that ash once was. in it can be found the secret<br/>
                    chord that pleased the lord and the most lewd french song ever sung. somewhere<br/>
                    in the endless shelves you will find the histories of every world as well as the<br/>
                    science fiction short story that would have saved them from their multiple fates<br/>
                    <br/>
                    the point is, everything ever written on a page of 3200 characters is already in<br/>
                    the library of babel. this entire book was already in the library. all i had to<br/>
                    do to find it was write it. so who, then, is the real author. whence authority.<br/>
