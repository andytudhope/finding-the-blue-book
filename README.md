# Finding The Blue Book

Welcome to the fifth, final, and infinite part of The Blue Book trilogy. 

Rather than being written, this version has been found in the [libraryofbabel.info](https://libraryofbabel.info), where all possible pages of 3200 characters (using latin letters, a space, a comma and period) have already been written. Read that sentence again. Every possible page. It's all in there. Of course, most of the library is unintelligble, so in order to find this book, I had to write it. But I was only writing what already exists.

In truth, this authorial question is perpetually open. So, each chapter has a "Guardian NFT", which I have given to people I love. This NFT can be used to change the html file which displays where the blue book has been found. The range of possible alterations to where the blue book is found is therefore as infinite as each guardian's innate creative potential.

I mean to create sacred economic space. Technologies like Ethereum bind financial value to every speech act. This means we can create ceremonial transaction types where every economic agent is also an artist by virtue of how they choose to express the value of their gifts. Ownership of a Guardian NFT is one such type, because any transaction you initiate with it - changing this site, selling it, doing absolutely nothing - is itself an artisitic statement.

## Current Game

I'm testing the idea for now. The rules are very simple:

PRs will only be accepted if there is a signed message on the Ethereum mainnet from the same account which owns the Guardian NFT for that chapter attached to them which includes the text:

```
I, <github_username>, being of sound mind and pure heart, have intentionally open <link_to_pr>. 
+ whatever other text you feel like adding.
```

I reserve the right to reject PRs if and only if they contain:

1. Malicious code
2. Advertising or tracking software
3. Pornography
4. Foul language
5. Anything commercial

## Possible Future Games

- [ ] Make my own NFT contract that lets the owner of an NFT update it's metadata URI
- [ ] Use Arweave to store the html files
- [ ] Put that Arweave ref in the Guardian NFTs metadata as the URI
- [ ] Write some javascript to fetch the html and display it on the site
